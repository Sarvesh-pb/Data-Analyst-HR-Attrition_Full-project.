Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition in an organization to understand the factors that influence employee turnover. By identifying key patterns and trends, I provided actionable insights to reduce attrition rates and improve employee retention strategies.

Dataset
In Form: Two Excel files
size: 50,000 rows.

Tools
Advance Excel,PowerBi,SQL.

Objectives
-Average attrition rate for all Departments
-Average hourly rate of Male Research Scientist 
-Attrition rate Vs Monthly Income stats 
-Average working years for each Department
-Job role Vs Work life balance
-Attrition rate Vs Years Since last promotion
Identify the primary factors contributing to employee attrition.
Provide actionable recommendations to the HR department to mitigate attrition.

The project involved working with large datasets from HR records, and I used a variety of tools to extract, transform, and load the data. I leveraged advanced Excel functionalities such as data validation, conditional formatting, and pivot tables to clean and organize the data. I also used SQL to join multiple tables and extract data needed for analysis.
Once the data was organized and cleaned.Finally, I used Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that incorporated all of the insights from the analysis. The dashboard included a variety of metrics such as average monthly income stats, attrition rate, work-life balance, year since last promotion, and working hours by department and job role. The dashboard allowed HR managers to quickly and easily monitor and analyze employee retention data and make informed decisions based on the insights derived from the data.
Overall, this project was an excellent opportunity for me to showcase my skills as a data analyst and use a variety of tools to extract insights from complex datasets. I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques and contribute to the data analysis community.
